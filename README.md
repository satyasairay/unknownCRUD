# Unknown CRUD Library

This repository collects the documentation, backend services, and frontend experience for the Unknown CRUD Library project.

## Project Layout

- `backend_py/` – Python backend service code and related tooling.
- `frontend/` – Client-side application (framework TBD).
- `data/library/` – Seed data, fixtures, and reference assets.
- `docs/` – Product and engineering documentation. See `docs/index.md`.
- `scripts/` – Project automation, local tooling, and maintenance scripts.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the environment examples:  
   - `cp backend_py/env.example backend_py/.env`  
   - `cp frontend/env.example frontend/.env`
2. Install dependencies for each stack (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `npm install`).
3. Follow service-specific run instructions once they are added.

## Documentation

All core documentation lives under `docs/`. Start with [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) for an overview and deep links into each spec.
